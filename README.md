MATLAB Ultrasonic C-Scan Post-Processing Tool

This MATLAB script, contour_plot_FB_1.m, is designed to process ultrasonic Time-of-Flight (TOF) data from Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) samples to visualise and quantify internal delamination damage. It supports both .csv and .mat TOF data files, and can produce:

1. 2D damage group plots

2. 3D segmented plots of front and back scans
   
4. Hybrid 3D merged visualisation combining both scans
   
6. Freehand-drawn thresholded damage area analysis using a binary mask
